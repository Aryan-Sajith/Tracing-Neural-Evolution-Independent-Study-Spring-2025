## Brief:
Here we explore the Transformer architecture, a pivotal development that revolutionized sequence modeling by entirely replacing recurrent connections with attention mechanisms. Introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need," this approach enables superior parallelization and captures global dependencies more effectively, establishing new state-of-the-art results in tasks like machine translation and serving as the foundation for modern large language models (LLMs).
